# LSTD: A Low-Shot Transfer Detector for Object Detection

### Introduction

LSTD is an unified framework for transfer object detetction with a single network. For more details, please refer to our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01529v1).
Framework  
LSTD is a network combining the advantage of SSD and Faster-RCNN, where it shares the two-stage detection framework with 
the feature pyramid of SSD.
